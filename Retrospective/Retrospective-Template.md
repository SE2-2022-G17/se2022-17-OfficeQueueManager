TEMPLATE FOR RETROSPECTIVE (Team 17)
=====================================

The retrospective should include _at least_ the following
sections:

- [process measures](#process-measures)
- [quality measures](#quality-measures)
- [general assessment](#assessment)

## PROCESS MEASURES 

### Macro statistics

- Number of stories committed vs. done: 5 vs 4 
- Total points committed vs. done: 13 vs 18
- Nr of hours planned vs. spent (as a team): 54h vs 40h

**Remember**a story is done ONLY if it fits the Definition of Done:
 
- Unit Tests passing
- Code review completed
- Code present on VCS
- End-to-End tests performed

> Please refine your DoD if required (you cannot remove items!)

> place technical tasks corresponding to story `#0` and leave out story points (not applicable in this case)

- Hours per task average ≃ 40 / x ≃ 31 ≃ 1h 18m, standard deviation (estimate and actual):≃ (55.80, 49.36)
- Total task estimation error ratio: sum of total hours estimation / sum of total hours spent - 1 = 44h45m	39h28m = 1.11875 - 1 = 0.11875 ≃ 12%


  
## QUALITY MEASURES 

- Unit Testing:
  - Total hours estimated
  - Total hours spent
  - Nr of automated unit test cases 
  - Coverage (if available)
- E2E testing:
  - Total hours estimated
  - Total hours spent
- Code review 
  - Total hours estimated 
  - Total hours spent
  



## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)? 
<br/>We overstimated time spent in the UI implementation and undestimated time spent to learn how to test in Node js  

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint? <br/>Negative: our capability to commit to an high number of user stories<br/>
Positive: use of a well known technology (React and Node js)

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve? 
  
- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)
<br/>Improve tasks assignment to members of the team
<br/>

> Propose one or two

- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!
<br/>
Great spirit of cooperation
